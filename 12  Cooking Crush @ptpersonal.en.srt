Of course, Mr. Ten.

It’s Prem. I remember.

32
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,000
He taught Ten Deep Fried Shrimp Cakes the other day.

60
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,000
I went into your room.

61
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,280
I had a reason though.

62
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,600
My phone charger was broken.

63
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:02,560
I kinda needed it so I went in to borrow yours.

64
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,200
And I came across this note on a box while I was looking for your charger..

65
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,960
Honestly, I didn’t realize what it was at first.

66
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,960
I’m sorry.

67
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,600
Besides going into my room without my permission,

68
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,800
you snooped around too?

69
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,560

70
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,280
Ten, do explain.

71
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,680
Doc, let me explain.

72
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,080
That message was written by my sister.

73
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,080
But I reckon that she wrote it playfully, with no real intent.

74
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,000
I admit that it was not a nice thing to do.

75
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,280
I spent some of the money I got.

76
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,680
However, I aim to pay back every bit of it.

77
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,400
I'll take your word for it.

78
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,960
I hope you can follow through on what you've said.

79
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,800
Return the money to us.

80
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,600
Why do we need the money back?

81
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,200
Do we have a financial shortfall?

82
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,600
It's not just about the money.

83
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,400
It's about keeping one's word.

84
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,200
Or was it merely said to skate by?

85
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,200
Much like his sister's playful message, with no real intent.

86
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,680
And then, taking no responsibility for the consequences—

87
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,600
just an apology, hoping it all fades away?

88
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,480
Prem is responsible enough.

89
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,400
Alright.

90
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,800
I’ll find a way to earn money and repay you.

91
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,880
It would be great if you could do it sooner.

92
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,280
Oi, Prem.

93
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,240
I’m truly sorry.

94
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,360
It’s all my fault.

95
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,600
I’m really sorry.

96
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,600
I didn’t mean for this to happen. Please don’t take offense to his words.

97
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:14,000
The rich sometimes have a peculiar way of thinking, unlike us.

98
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,680
I’m really sorry.

99
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,000
Sorry.

100
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,680
Are you still worrying about my father's words?

101
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,800
Um.

102
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,400
I’m worried knowing your father doesn’t feel okay with me.

103
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,680
Don’t worry about anyone else.

104
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,080
Just focus on what we have.

105
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,000
He’s not just anyone else; he’s your father.

106
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,000
Let me sort that out with him.

107
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,040
You’d rather worry about your competition for now.

108
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,280
Don’t worry about him.

109
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,800
No,

110
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,280
I’ll make it happen.

111
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,400
I’ll return the money to your father.

112
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,600
Then let me give you a hug as my support.

113
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,880
Does it look nice on me?

114
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,200
I asked Samsee to get me this.

115
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,080
What’s wrong?

116
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,400
Why are you making a buttface?

117
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,320
Huh?

118
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,480
Today,

119
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,800
Dr. Ten took me to meet his father.

120
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,480
He told his father I’m his boyfriend.

121
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,080
Really?

122
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,680
Did his father say anything?

123
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,480
A lot of things.

124
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,400
Share me one.

125
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,680
I’m not sleepy yet.

126
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,080
But there’s really a lot.

127
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,280
A lot indeed.

128
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,000
Hold on.

129
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,480
Give me your hand.

130
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,600
Hey, your hand. Take it out.

131
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,800
Come on. Open your palm.

132
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:37,040
This is for not letting me know about Pang’s lost tuition fee money.

133
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,680
And this is for charging Dr. Ten 200,000 baht.

134
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,720
And this is for the message on the note that Pang wrote.

135
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,400
Oh-oh, almost.

136
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,480
Now is the consolation mode.

137
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,600
Have you thought about how you'll earn 200,000 baht to repay him?

138
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,600
I don’t know yet.

139
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,240
Come on, it’s not that hard to think of a way.

140
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,600
I could think of two ways already.

141
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,600
Which are...

142
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,000
Robbing a bank or a gold shop.

143
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,680
Kidding.

144
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:23,080
You can borrow from me or win that Monster Monstrous show.

145
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,200
The winning cash prize is 3 million, isn’t it?

146
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,200
Do you think I could win that?

147
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,200
Then take my money to repay him.

148
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,880
No.

149
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,000
If I can win the money by my ability, it’s much cooler.

150
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,440
Listen to me, Prem.

151
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,600
The turning point in a person's life doesn’t come around often.

152
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,480
You must give it all

153
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,280
you’ve got with no regrets when looking back.

154
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,400
Doc, what should I do? I’m really nervous.

155
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,000
I feel like my heart is going to pop out.

156
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,200
It’s not out.

157
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,600
You can’t hear it with that.

158
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,480
Can you hear it now?

159
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,800
Yes, I can hear it now.

160
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,000
How do I shake off this nervousness?

161
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,800
Has it gone yet?

162
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,880

Enough.

168
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,000
You’re making me even more nervous.

169
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,680
My face is heating up.

170
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,600
Do your best, Chef.

171
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,520
I’m cheering for you.

172
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,400
You can do it.

173
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,080
Shit, Prem. Do you hear it?

174
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,680
The cheering for Boon’s team is freaking loud.

175
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,360
Is it too late to go home?

176
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,000
Hold on.

177
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,800
Listen, Unky.

178
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,880
Even though no one is here rooting for us,

179
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,400
we have come too far to turn back. We must fight on!

180
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,000
We must win!

181
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,080
Yes, we must win only!

182
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,480
Say that you must win.

183
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,280
Say it.

184
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,120
We must win.

185
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,960
We must win.

186
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,640
We must win.

187
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,800
We must win.

188
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,000
We must win.

189
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,080
We must win.

190
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,400
We must win.

191
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,600
We must win.

192
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,920
We must win.

193
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,000
We must win.

194
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
We must win.

195
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,520
We must win.

196
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,600
This is for you, Dr. Ten.

197
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,520
And this one is for you.

198
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,520
Thank you.

199
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,520
This one…

200
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,360
would you like to hold it?

201
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,880
No, it’ll make my hand sore to hold it for a long time.

202
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,000
Then, I must hold it.

203
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,880
Excuse me?

204
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,000
Are you here rooting for this team?

205
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,320
Yes, my son is a contestant.

206
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,280
Your son? Which contestant?

207
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,680
My son is Samsee.

208
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,200
Are you also rooting for Samsee’s team?

209
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:32,960
Yes.

210
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,640
I’m Prem’s grandma.

211
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,960
Oh, nice to meet you.

212
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,800
Nice to meet you.

213
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,680
Let’s get in there.

214
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,960
Mise en Place!

215
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,440
Mise en Place!

216
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,080
Mise en Place!

217
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,480
Mise en Place!

218
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,000
Mise en Place!

219
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,280
Mise en Place!

220
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,680
Mise en Place!

221
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,120
Mise en Place!

222
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,600
Mise en Place!

223
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,000
Mise en Place!

224
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,280
Mise en Place!

225
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,200
Mise en Place!

226
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,600
This is the final battle

227
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,560
between the top-performing team, Mise en Place,

228
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,240
and the dark horse, The Three Must-Eat-eers,

229
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,800
who incredibly made it to the final round.

230
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,640
I can't wait to see

231
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,520
what techniques both teams employ in their final dishes.

232
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,920
Just now, we saw Team Mise en Place put beef on the charcoal grill.

233
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,920
Woah, I’m worried for The Three Must-Eat-eers team.

234
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,880
Do they have the edge to outplay their opponent?

235
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,960
I don’t think they made it to the final round out of pure luck.

236
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,280
They must all have equal talent.

237
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,280
Who will win this battle? Let’s find out together.

238
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,800
This dish is called “Triumphant Tom Kha Gai.”

239
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,600
What makes this dish special?

240
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,480
Why is it called 'Triumphant'?

241
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,960
It’s my grandmother’s recipe.

242
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,400
I adapted by adding a unique twist with aromatic green oil.

243
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:23,080
It features soft and tender chicken mousse complemented by tangy lime jelly.

244
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,920
But what truly makes it triumphant is that

245
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,600
it's the first dish the three of us got to cook together

246
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,480
after our rigorous culinary theory study.

247
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,800
In the first year, we were all required to focus on math for calculations.

248
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,600
In the second year, we could only chop vegetables

249
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,480
and prepare other ingredients, until our hands hurt.

250
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,200
In the third year, we were tasked with deboning chicken

251
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,960
until we mastered the muscle structure of every part.

252
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,680
So, Tom Kha Gai holds a special place in our memory.

253
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,760
It's not just because of its delicious flavor,

254
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,480
but also because it's a dish our professor refused to try

255
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,280
when we failed to deliver it on time.

256
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,960
- Tom Kha Gai
- I'm not going to taste this dish.

257
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,080
Regardless of how excellent this dish might be,

258
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,000
if it's not completed within the allocated time, I won’t evaluate it.

259
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,680
Poor time management that day taught us a lesson

260
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,880
and motivated us to improve and be better today.

261
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,680
From being perceived as incapable that day,

262
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:25,000
now we all stand here cooking the dish we once failed,

263
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,040
turning it into a successful

264
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,800
and memorable experience for the rest of our lives.

265
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,480
In addition to the sense of overcoming self-challenge,

266
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,400
this dish also holds significant meaning for me.

267
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,600
It brought me someone special—

268
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:51,680
someone who can make me smile and laugh,

269
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,000
who's willing to do everything for me without hesitation,

270
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,480
and who builds confidence in me

271
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,000
when I doubt anything or myself.

272
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,600
I’m not lame, right?

273
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,000
These two hands create the most delicious food in the world.

274
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,280
A simple dish from an ordinary man

275
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,400
with an extraordinary story like mine

276
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:31,960
can impress and bring me triumph in Super Monster Chef.

277

285
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,280
The winning team is…

286
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,200
is…

287
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,200
is…

288
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
is…

289
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,800
Team Mise en Place!

290
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,600
Are you commending us for surpassing tough teams?

291
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,000
We’re truly amazing, aren’t we?

292
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,720
Holy shit, I could understand his gesture.

293
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,400
I could finally understand him.

294
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,600
Keep on practicing.

295
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,800
What? He can speak.

296
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,280
Why didn’t he speak earlier?

297
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,400
Keeping character?

298
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,400
Congrats, Prem.

299
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,680
Thank you so much.

300
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,080
Thank you.

301
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,880
Congratulations.

302
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,400
Thank you.

303
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,800
Thank you very much.

304
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,360
Congrats.

305
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,880
Thank you so much, Chang Ma.

306
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,880
It’s alright, guys.

307
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,600
We did really well to get this far.

308
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,200
This is life.

309
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,880
Effort doesn’t always guarantee success.

310
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,800
Thank you, guys.

311
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,000
The Three Must-Eat-eers did very well.

312
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,680
Let’s give them a big hand.

313
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,000
Woah.

314
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,360
Woo, woo, woo!

315
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,800
Where’s Firefy?

316
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,480
My friends keep sending me this clip.

317
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,200
What is it about? Explain it to me.

318
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,600
Well, I…

319
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,720
Hi. Are you also here to cheer for us too, Mother?

320
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,080
Don’t call me “Mother.”

321
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,480
It’s good that you’re here.

322
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,200
Let’s talk this out together.

323
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,400
Are you trying to deceive my son?

324
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,080
How could he behave in such a way?

325
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,800
Deceive him how?

326
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,680
How dare you question me back?

327
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,800
My son is a great kid.

328
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,000
He’s never gone astray.

329
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,680
But he displayed such appalling behavior in public nationwide.

330
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,280
I don’t care about your preferences,

331
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,880
but please stay away from my son.

332
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,480
Don’t drag him down with you.

333
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,680
Fire, didn’t I tell you to choose who you hang out with wisely?

334
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,400
And look at him.

335
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,880
He must have deliberately approached you with the intention

336
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,080
to be more than just a friend.

337
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,560
You didn’t know, right?

338
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,600
I did know.

339
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,680
What did you say?

340
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,200
I knew.

341
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,480
I knew it for quite a while.

342
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,600
And you let him be around you?

343
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,480
What were you thinking?

344
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,080
I didn’t think with my brain.

345
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,600
I followed my feelings.

346
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,600
The feelings that have been in my heart for a long time.

347
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,400
You know, Mom?

348
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,000
Every time I’m around you,

349
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,400
I never dare to speak up.

350
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,680
I never dare to express my true feelings.

351
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,400
I don’t want to hurt your feelings.

352
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,000
I’m afraid you cannot accept who I am.

353
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,680
Fire.

354
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,960
I’ve been running away from what’s in my heart,

355
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,480
I tried to fool myself every day

356
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,400
that the life you had planned for me was probably the best one.

357
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,000
When you’re happy,

358
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,800
I’m happy.

359
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,200
But today…

360
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,800
I can’t do that for you anymore.

361
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,080
I’m sorry.

362
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,000
It’s gonna be okay, Fire.

363
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,800
(Every growth comes with pain and tears.)

364
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,480
- This makes me so proud of you already.
- (I agree with this saying.)

365
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,480
Pang, let’s get something to drink.

366
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,800
My throat is dry from yelling.

367
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,920
Okay, Grandma.

368
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,280
We’ll be back.

369
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,600
Don’t be sad.

370
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,480
You did your best.

371
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,600
I know.

372
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,880
My best is not good enough for the judges.

373
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,600
Don’t say that.

374
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,680
I’m not done yet.

375
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,280
What I meant is that

376
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,800
even though today I’m not good enough for the judges,

377
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,880
I believe there are people who admire our dedication.

378
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,600
I may not win today,

379
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,480
but I will win tomorrow.

380
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,200
This version of you is so…

381
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,280
What?

382
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,600
So much cuter.

383
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,960
I can be much, much cuter.

384
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,200
How?

385
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,600
Hey.

386
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,520
Chef.

387
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,480
Chef!

388
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,480
What are you doing?

389
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,600
You caught me off guard with this before.

390
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,760
But this time, I'm prepared and on guard

391
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,000
I want to return the favor.

392
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,800
How?

393
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,000
Chef.

394
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:43,880
Chef.

395
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,600
Chef.

396
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,320
Chef.

397
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,000
Chef.

398
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,800
Returning the favor in this way is what I love, you know.

399
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,680
Chef!

400
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,680
(It’s also true)

401
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:14,200
(that healthy love can give you the energy and encouragement)

402
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,200
(needed to make informed decisions about what you should do.)

403
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,960
This is the entire amount Ten paid for my cooking course.

404
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,000
I’m returning it as I said I would.

405
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,200
I’d like to prove to you that I’m the man of my word.

406
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,600
I’m trying.

407
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,800
I’m trying to improve and be better.

408
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:56,680
Actually, I tried very hard to win that competition

409
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,200
to show you that I have some worth to be on the same level as Ten.

410
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,680
Though it turned out that I didn’t win,

411
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,600
I refuse to give up.

412
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,480
I'll do whatever it takes to earn your acceptance

413
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,600
and to make you see that my feelings toward your son are genuine.

414

[Tom Kha Gai]

415
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,360
[From the Three Must-Eat-eers, Super Monster Chef’s runner up.]

416
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,080
Welcome.

417
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,920
- Table of three, right?
- Yes.

418
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,760
Have you made a reservation?

419
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,800
(My grandma’s restaurant is getting popular again)

420
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,480
(from the people who watched the show and her old customers.)

421
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,320
Excuse me, please take my order too.
(from the people who watched the show and her old customers.)

422
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,800
Table Two, please shut up.
(from the people who watched the show and her old customers.)

423
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,160
(from the people who watched the show and her old customers.)

424
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,800
Here’s your Fried Pork Toast.
(from the people who watched the show and her old customers.)

425
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,280
- (But she’s just chill and lets others work their tails off.)
- Please enjoy.

426
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,960
- Excuse me. Can I have the bill?
- Sure, just a moment please.

427
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,680
Hot, hot, hot.

428
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,680
Why don’t you use this glove?

429
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,000
The person who fixed it might get upset.

430
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,680
Okay, I won’t take it off again.

431
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,280
Would you mind showing your affection elsewhere?

432
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,680
I’m envious.

433
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:27,960
(The joy of a cook is seeing smiles on the faces of those enjoying their dishes.)

434
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,480
Thank you so much.

435
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,360
Table Two is very hungry here!

436
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,280
It’s none of my business, it’s yours.

437
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,480
How come it’s not your business.

438
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,880
Isn’t this restaurant your business?

439
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,240
Tell Table Two to quiet down, or else no food will be served!

440
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,720
Tell him that I’m going to eat and I refuse to be quiet.

441
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,280
Okay, no food for Table Two. Period.

442
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,000
Thank you.

443
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,800
Thank you. Thank you very much.

444
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,880
Go ahead.

445
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,480
Okay. One, two, three.

446
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,880
Here you go.

447
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,360
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

448
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,960
We’ll come back again.

449
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,760
Thank you.

450
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,000
Don’t forget to let your friends or boyfriends know about our place.

451
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,880
Gosh, so tired.

452
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,680
Here. I know you must be tired. Drink this, babe.

453
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,240
Thank you so much, cutie babe.

454
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,280
Hey, Unky.

455
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,800
What’s wrong with your mouth?

456
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,400
Don’t go overboard.

457
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,480
Wait for my sister to graduate from college first.

458
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,960
Until that day comes,

459
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,160
Unky is probably eating with false teeth.

460
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,200
(You must be wondering since when these two started their relationship.)

461
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,760
Your sister is using my picture for a meme for sure.

462
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,400
So cute.

463
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,640
- (In fact, Pang avoided Unky because she felt smitten by him.)
- Pang! Join us for a hotpot?

464
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,680
Come and join us.

465
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,400
I'm going to buy it now.

466
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,000
(Turns out Pang had a long crush on Unky.)

467
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,640
(But he thought Pang disliked him.)

468
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,640
- Would you like to hold it?
- No.
(But he thought Pang disliked him.)

469
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,480
it’ll make my hand sore to hold it for a long time.
- (I also thought she disliked him.)

470
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,800
- Then, I must hold it.
- (One day, Unky lost it and cornered her.)

471
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,680
Pang.

472
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,000
Pang!

473
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,200
Pang! Wait.

474
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:01,960
Pang.

475
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,960
Come back here.

476
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,240
Pang! Wait.

477
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,000
Wait.

478
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,960
(Why do you keep avoiding me?)

479
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,000
(Did I do something that made you hate me?)

480
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,000
(I don’t hate you.)

481
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,680
(I’m shy.)

482
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,960
What?

483
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,280
(Then they end up like you see here.)

484
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,200
Sorry, we’re closed.

485
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,600
I’m here to eat.

486
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,600
I heard you finished in second place?

487
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,080
I came here to try your food.

488
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,400
I’m curious if your cooking tastes like your grandmother’s.

489
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,280
But…

490
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,200
I’m not here to eat for free.

491
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,880
Come on.

492
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,480
Take it.

493
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,800
I understand now what my son saw in you.

494
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,480
Dad.

495
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:58,880
Why?

496
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,080
Why do you always make such a face with me?

497
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,880
Can’t I visit here to have some food?

498
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,600
Are you here alone?

499
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,280
Who else should I come with?

500
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,880
Charlotte?

501
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,800
When she heard that I was coming here, she wouldn’t want to join.

502
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,000
Because she knows this is the place for me, your mother, and you.

503
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,280
This is your mother’s favorite place.

504
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,280
After she fell sick, she couldn’t come here anymore.

505
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,080
You must have thought I didn't do anything after I found out she was sick?

506
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,000
Hm?

507
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,600
Let me tell you something.

508
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,680
Sometimes, we don’t need to tell everyone about what we’re doing.

509
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:59,080
I tried to find a way and do everything I could,

510
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,280
but in the end,

511
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,480
I couldn’t save her after all.

512
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,960
It hurt me too,

513
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,880
not any less than you.

514
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,080
I thought you didn’t want to remember anything about Mom.

515
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,960
Your mother is the only woman I married.

516
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,280
I’m hungry. Go make something for me.

517
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,680
Got it.

518
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,480
(I heard that)

519
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,160
(the warmth within a family isn't measured by the number of its members,)

520
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,600
(but by the depth of understanding among them.)

521
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:15,680
(I think Dr. Ten and his father have felt that warmth.)

522
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,600
Before he entered,

523
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,680
did my father say anything to you?

524
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,200
He said he understands you now

525
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,800
about what you saw in me.

526
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,200
That means he’s okay with you.

527
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,400
I think so.

528
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,240
Isn’t it great?

529
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,480
I could make my grandmother’s restaurant become vibrant again.

530
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,960
I see people happy having my food.

531
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,200
I’m really happy, Doc.

532
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,200
You always do something for others.

533
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,680
Well, I like to see people happy.

534
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,600
That’s why I fell in love with you.

535
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,880
Don’t you want to do something for yourself?

536
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,000
There is something.

537
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,600
I want to own my Chef’s Table place.

538
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,800
But I’m afraid I cannot do it all by myself.

539
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,480
Said who you have to do it all by yourself.

540
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,680
I’ll help too.

541
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,880
But…

542
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,600
I won’t do it for free.

543
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,000
Why?

544
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,000
Tell me you love me first.

545
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,600
I did. Hear it?

546
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,680
Not really.

547
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,240
I barely heard it.

548
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,200
Can you yell it at me loudly?

549
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,880
(Someone says if you do something out of love,)

550
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,280
(love will reward you in return.)

551
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,800
Thank you.

552
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:54,720
Sure.

553
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,000
Come here.

554
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,080
Congrats.

555
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,960
Thanks.

556
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,960
(Dynamite, who secretly admired his crush for so long,)

557
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,160
(finally got his chance with him.)

558
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:16,880
Can I check the picture?

559
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,720
Send it over.

560
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,280
Sure.

561
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,080
Fy.

562
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,280
Wow, thank you so much.

563
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,320
Congrats.

564
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,200
Ahem.

565
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,200
Not too much..

566
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,480
Sorry.

567
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,200
You look so handsome, my son.

568
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,960
Let’s take some pictures.

569
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,200
Photographer, please.

570
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,440
Hey.

571
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,400
If you want to be in the frame, step in.

572
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,960
Why are you standing so far away?

573
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:51,400
(It’s not easy for them to get to this point either.)

574
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,000
Fire, I must apologize to you

575
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,000
for being too strict.

576
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,880
My intention is to shape you into a good man.

577
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:09,800
I didn’t realize that what I did was suffocating you

578
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,000
and making it hard for you to be yourself.

579
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,800
From now on, whatever you want to do,

580
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,480
whoever you want to be with,

581
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,480
feel free to do so.

582
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,960
Thank you, Mother.

583
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,400
I love you, you know.

584
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,520
Hey, next time when you bring me food,

585
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,000
try to limit those with coconut milk.

586
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,960
You don’t like them, Mother?

587
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,080
I do like them, but my doctor doesn’t.

588
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,000
I was asked to limit them.

589
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,440
I enjoy them too much and it increases my risk of diabetes.

590
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,880
Don’t just stand there.

591
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,880
Come pay your respect to her.

592
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,480
Come on.

593
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,600
You want me to give you a massage?

594
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,800
No, thanks. Go sit there.

595
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,840
(Our issues have dissolved and become things of the past,)

596
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,200
(leaving behind nostalgic flavors to reminisce upon.)

597
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:23,640
YEARS LATER

598
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,400
(Now, it’s down to us to season our own lives)
YEARS LATER

599
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:31,000
(to achieve the perfect flavor that suits our individual tastes the best.)
YEARS LATER

600
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,360
YEARS LATER

601
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,800
Don’t forget to revisit this patient again tomorrow

602
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,680
and check if the condition improves.

603
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,600
Got it.

604
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,960
That’s all for today.

605
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,520
Please excuse me then.

606
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,640
I have an important appointment today.

607
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,480
Goodbye.

608
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,360
[Im Prem]

609
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,400
We’re open now.

610
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,280
The first pair of customers, please come in.

611
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,880
Hi, how are you?

612
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,960
Look at your sweet smiles and happy faces.

613
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,720
- Can't you two let go of each other's hands for a second?
- Oh, sorry. They are glued.

614
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,200
You two are too much.

615
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,360
Go ahead. Go inside.

616
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:06,920
Thank you.

617
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,080
Wow, your place is nice.

618
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,440
Is our food ready, my fellow chef?

619
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,280
I’m hungry.

620
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,680
Hang tight.

621
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,600
Your grandma took so long to open the doors.

622
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,000
You’re giving me a headache.

623
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,760
Hello.

624
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,560
Get in.

625
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,760
You’re so bubbling. I can’t with you.

626
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,200
Here.

627
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,000
What? That’s not for me, babe?

628
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:42,400
Hey, Unky. You’re going full stream now that my sister has graduated.

629
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,360
Oh!

630
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,200
What’s wrong?

631
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,560
- Hello.
- Hello.

632
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,120
Woah. You look so nice today.

633
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,800
You have a rich owner's aura now.

634
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,480
Thanks.

635
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,240
Go in.

636
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,000
Nice blouse.

637
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,000
Isn’t it a monk's robe?

638
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,160
Prem, serve us something, please.

639
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,520
Crackers or nuts would do. I’m starving.

640
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,280
Yeah.

641
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,800
Hey, This is a Chef’s Table, not a banquet.

642
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,200
Wait a bit more. It’s nearly done.

643
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,680
Do you need a hand?

644
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,000
All good here, Grandma.

645
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,920
You can wait for the customers in front.

646
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,000
There could be other customers too.

647
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,040
Okay.

648
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,280
Oh, you scared me.

649
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,040
- Hello.
- Hello. Come in.

650
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,720
That’s one big smile.

651
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,160
I’m here.

652
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,880
Sorry, the traffic was bad.

653
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,800
Hey. Let me help.

654
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,480
Awwwwwwww.

655
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,680
“Let me help.”

656
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,120
Are we going to have super duper sweet food instead?

657
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,960
Yeah. I think you probably need an insulin injection after this.

658
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,280
Why me?

659
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,640
You may get diabetes from their food.

660
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,480
That’s too harsh.

661
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,360
[Super delicious.]
[Fried Pork Toast is the best]

662
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,080
[What a cute place, food’s great. Wishing you prosperity!]

663
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:24,200
[Love the special dish.]
[So good]

664
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,360
[Your food makes me happy.] / [Awesome.] / [Made with love.]
[Pang is cute.] / [We’ll be back again.] / [Prem FC] / [Unky Samsee FC]

665
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,280
[Im Prem]

666
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,480
Are you tired?

667
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,880
You’ve been working all day long.

668
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,000
Yes, tired.

669
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,280
But I’m happy that I can finally realize my dreams.

670
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,200
What about you? Aren’t you tired?

671
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,480
Not at all.

672
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,680
You’ve been cooking for your customers.

673
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,600
Now, it’s time for me to cook for you, my beloved.

674
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:07,960
Please wait a bit.

675
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,280
This is Super My Boyfriend Chef.

676
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,280
The food today is called

677
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,960
“Fish & Rice Romance”

678
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,600
How was this made?

679
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:48,600
I won’t tell you.

680
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,800
What are the ingredients?

681
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:51,800
I won’t tell you.

682
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,880
The only thing I can tell you is that

683
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,800
this is a secret dish that Ten will make for Prem only.

684
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,680
Ten will never make this dish to anyone ever.

685
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,680
Please enjoy.

686
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:10,200
Did it take long to come up with “Super My Boyfriend Chef”?

687
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,200
Just when I fried this fish.

688
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,200
Dig in.

689
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,000
How does it taste, Chef?

690
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,480
It’s delicious, Doc.

691
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,400
Knock yourself out.

692
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,600
(The main course is finished.)

693
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,200
(Now, it’s time for something sweet.)

694
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,280
It smells good.

695
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,000
I’ve yet to fry it.

696
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,600
I meant…

697
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,680
you.

698
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,280
Doc!

699
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,080
I’m already hungry.

700
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,800
Alright, I’ll speed it up.

701
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,400
I didn’t mean that.

702
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,960
I meant this.

703
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,000
You just had it last night.

704
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,800
I can never get enough of delicious stuff.

705
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,160
You want more?

706
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:43,600
Yes.
