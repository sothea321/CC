[Can you come out now? Shall we meet?]
[Just as you came across the Instagram? Hahahaha
All right, shall we go drink?]

00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,280
[Empty]

170
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,590
Gosh. I wasted my taxi fare.

171
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,590
You brazenly said you got dumped.

172
00:14:56,590 --> 00:15:00,730
Hey, who takes in someone who asks to stay the first day they met?

173
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,260
Just because you look good?

174
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:03,440
Yeah.

175
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,520
You must... You must be happy. You have a trustworthy face.

176
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,650
Can you let me stay at your place? Just for three days?

177
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,160
Hold on.

178
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,860
Hello, Mom. Can we

179
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:24,060
let my friend Yoondae stay at our house just for one night–

180
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,460
What?

181
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,550
-I'm preparing to retake my exam for the third time so my mom is really sensitive.
-Damn it.

182
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,920
Then why are you delivering food? You're doing a third retake.

183
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,810
So?

184
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,140
Do I buy Daiso earpods for my mother's birthday?

185
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,760
I should at least buy her Apple Earpods so it's not embarrassing.

186
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,510
You're so romantic, Mr. Jung Kyungwoo.

187
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,640
-You have an order.
-I've got an order. I'll get going.

188
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,480
Stop messing around. Your dad is going to go crazy.

189
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,980
Did you hear that? Go back quickly. Why isn't it buckling?

190
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,030
I'll get going.

191
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:57,150
Hey! Or go to your brother!

192
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,040
How dare you call him my brother?

193
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,750
So what's the baptism name?

194
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,960
Oh, Angela.

195
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,210
I didn't choose it.

196
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,710
They chose it.

197
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,680
I bought an insurance in your name.

198
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,560
There's a lady I know who sells insurance.

199
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,600
No wonder she's close to everyone.

200
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,610
Did Yoondae's father call you?

201
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,230
Yoondae's father? Why?

202
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,480
No, it's nothing.

203
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,860
Mom, I should get going.

204
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,910
Oh. Okay.

205
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,410
Uh, Soohyuk.

206
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,990
Can I move?

207
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,380
Because there's something that I want to get a loan for

208
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,920
but they aren't approving it for me.

209
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:57,460
So I want to move into a smaller house.

210
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,720
You're paying the rent. So I thought I should ask you.

211
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,730
You want to take the deposit and use it?

212
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,550
It's because of Dad, right?

213
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,569
You must be tired of it.

214
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,730
I'm tired of it too.

215
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,480
But I can't think of any other way.

216
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,400
Everyone say we shouldn't do this,

217
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:24,329
but we can't treat him like an outsider.

218
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,450
Me too.

219
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,040
I'm the same too.

220
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,090
I'll transfer the money to you today.

221
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,630
So please don't move.

222
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:01,320
Aren't you home? There aren't other repairman at the office.

223
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,120
Open the door if you're home.

224
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,620
I'll leave as soon as I'm done.

225
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,290
Call Jihee.

226
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,420
I already moved out.

227
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,670
I'm sorry.

228
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,260
There's only water at home.

229
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,420
Thank you.

230
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,010
Is your boyfriend out?

231
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,180
We broke up.

232
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:35,520
Was he rude to you

233
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,730
or did he file a complaint...

234
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:38,570
Complaint?

235
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,820
I'm sorry. He's quite really rude

236
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,320
but he wouldn't do that for no reason.

237
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,420
Looks like you broke up on good terms.

238
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,750
You're still defending him?

239
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,460
Who can break up on good terms?

240
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,800
It's just... I can't take it anymore.

241
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:09,020
Well... I had some realizations.

242
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:22,320
That no matter what I do nothing will change about this man.

243
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,300
What are you looking at? Damn it.

244
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:42,800
Where are you going?

245
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,390
Isn't this what you chose?

246
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,790
Isn't that a failure too?

247
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,790
They say foolish people are incurable.

248
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,850
You'll have to live like this forever.

249
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,100
Do you have anywhere to go?

250
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:44,910
As long as they're men it's okay?

251
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,470
Yes. So don't think of staying here for too long.

252
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,800
Are you threatening me?

253
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,120
How long do I have to do this for, Father?

254
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,300
For how much longer?

255
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,900
Just say it if you're tired.

256
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,120
Can you just...

257
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,980
think that I only made one mistake.

258
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,650
